# Password-Generator
Made this for my personal use. Just a simple password generator. Nothing more nothing special.
Don't expect much or it to do a whole lot.


# Building
Windows/Linux build scripts are in the build folder. When run will make a temp dir and copy files into it then
make the jar file(same folder as the build scripts) and remove the temp dir.
